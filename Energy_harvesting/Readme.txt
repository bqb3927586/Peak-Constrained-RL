Generate.py is used to generate the data used in the leraning and comprison.

sim_learning.py uses energy.npy and learns to converge to optimal. plot_learn.py gives the Figure 2 in the paper.

Compare.py uses energy8-12.npy to compare different algorithms and saves the result. Then, Compare.plot gives the Figure3 in the paper.
